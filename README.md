Airdrops by WholeCrpyoto is a native Android app written in Java.

This project is a part of the Airdrops by Wholecrypto solutions built for iOS, and the web.

# Abstract
In terms of cryptocurrencies, airdrops are a way for cryptocurrency project owners to market themselfs. The tradeoff is simple:
Project owners will give small amount of their coin/token they develop to users.
In exchange, project owners may ask users for specific tasks.

Example: I am creating a project called "OfirCoin", which has a token/coin named "OFC" .
I decided to create an airdrop, limited to 100 users. For each user, I will distribute 50 OFC (equivalent to 5$) for every participant who likes my Facebook page, and join my Telegram channel.

# Features
The app displays a list of cryptocurrency airdrops. Users can mark airdrops as done, save airdrops for "to-do" later, notifiy users once a new airdrop is submitted, connect their wallet and social accounts, and many more.

Cryptocurrency Owners can submit their airdrop through the Android app, iOS app or the web.


# Development Environment
The app currently written in Java and uses the Gradle build system. </br>
Firebase Real Time DB to store airdrops, and synchronize any changes to the db in real time.</br>
Firebase authentication for user registration (gmail and regular email).</br>
Firebase remote control for Terms & Service.</br>
Airdrops are sent for manual inspection. Once passed admin authorization, the airdrop will appear to users in realtime.</br>
